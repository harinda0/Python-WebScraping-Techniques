# Python Web Scraping Techniques

## Overview
This repository contains three projects that demonstrate different web scraping techniques using Python. The projects focus on scraping data from Amazon's Best Selling Books list using BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and lxml. Each project involves the following steps:

- **Scraping Data**: Extract data such as book titles, authors, ratings, and prices from the web pages.
- **Creating CSV Files**: Save the extracted data into CSV files for further analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform data cleaning, handle missing values (NaNs), and analyze the data to find the highest-priced books, top-rated books, and most customer-rated books.
- **Performance Comparison**: Measure and compare the processing times of each web scraping technique to determine their efficiency and suitability for different scenarios.

## Projects in this Repository
1. **BeautifulSoup Web Scraping**:
   - **File**: `BeautifulSoup.ipynb`
   - **Description**: This project uses BeautifulSoup to scrape data from Amazon's Best Selling Books. The notebook covers the entire process, from importing necessary libraries to saving the scraped data into a CSV file and performing EDA. The performance of the scraping process is also evaluated.

2. **Selenium Web Scraping**:
   - **File**: `Selenium.ipynb`
   - **Description**: Selenium is used to automate web browser interactions for scraping data from Amazon's Best Selling Books. The project demonstrates how to handle dynamic web content, save data into a CSV file, and perform EDA. The project also includes a performance analysis of the scraping process.

3. **lxml Web Scraping**:
   - **File**: `lxml.ipynb`
   - **Description**: The lxml library is utilized for efficient parsing and scraping of data from Amazon's Best Selling Books. The notebook includes steps for data extraction, CSV file creation, and EDA, along with a performance comparison with BeautifulSoup and Selenium.
